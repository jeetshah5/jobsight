Data Scientist, Mid

The Opportunity

Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by machine learning and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection to cancer research to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data. You will work with different government stakeholders to build and maintain automated data workflows and pipelines, develop solutions to ingest, store, and distribute structured and unstructured data from disparate sources into a single location in the cloud, and support data driven decision making and knowledge sharing.

We have an opportunity for you to use your leadership and analytical skills to improve data analytics platforms and analytics for the Navy. You’ll work closely with your customer to understand their questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll mentor teammates, develop algorithms, write scripts, build predictive analytics, use automation, apply machine learning, and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help Navy strategic, operational, and tactical leaders make informed decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. As a technical leader, you’ll identify new opportunities to use data science solutions to help your customers meet their toughest challenges.

Join us. The world can’t wait.
