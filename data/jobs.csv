Required Qualifications:
• Bachelor’s degree in data science, computer science, applied mathematics, or a related field.
• 1–3 years of experience working with real-world data in a professional or academic setting.
• Proficiency with Python and data libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
• Familiarity with version control, SQL, and basic data engineering principles.

Preferred Experience:
• Familiarity and/or experience with state public transportation agencies, federal and state governing agencies and bodies and their regulations and requirements for infrastructure planning or delivery.
• Knowledge of public infrastructure data types such as GTFS, sensor data, or capital asset records.
• Experience with open-source visualization platforms (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).
• Interest in climate, equity, or sustainability analytics.

Why Join ARC:
• You’ll be part of a team that applies technology and policy together to support climate, equity, and infrastructure resilience.
