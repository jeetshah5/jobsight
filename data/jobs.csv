About Foundation

Foundation is building AI that surfaces the narratives driving economic outcomes. Our platform detects early warning signals hidden in text data—like consumer complaints, forums, and regulatory filings—starting in the $841B used car market.

We’ve built an early product that gives OEMs, insurers, and investors an 18-month lead on major recall and defect events. We’re former In-Q-Tel, SEC, BMW, Federal Reserve, Primer, and Anduril—building scalable, trustworthy language intelligence for high-stakes markets.

We’re currently in public beta and gearing up for our next funding round. We’re looking for a part-time data scientist to join as a core contributor and future leader.

What You’ll Do
• Develop NLP models for narrative detection and event clustering
• Analyze and visualize complaint timelines, recall signals, and anomaly detection
• Help refine and test our recall prediction models
• Collaborate on labeling data and training LLMs (open-source and proprietary)
• Co-design early versions of our “Recall Risk Score” and other key indicators
• Work closely with the founding team to shape product and platform decisions

You Might Be a Fit If You…
• Have experience with Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and NLP libraries (spaCy, Hugging Face, etc.)
• Are comfortable with time series, anomaly detection, and clustering methods
• Have worked with unstructured text data (forums, complaints, reviews, filings)
• Have a statistics, economics, or ML background—or love building models with real-world impact
• Want to work on high-impact, research-heavy problems in a fast-paced, early-stage startup

Why Join Foundation?
• Make a real-world impact on auto safety, regulation, and transparency
• Work with a PhD-led team of AI experts and industry veterans
